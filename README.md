# Comp116-final


The supporting materials of my Final Project for Introduction to Security. In it, I will be adapting 2 of our current security labs and creating a new lab that focus on a relationship between the InfoSec staff at Tufts and the CS Department.

The 3 labs are listed, and 2 examples of the phishing lab are included.
