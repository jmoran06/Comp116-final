<h1>COMP 116: Introduction to Computer Security</h1>
<h2>Lab 9: Technical Risk Analysis and Static Analysis (Adapted to work with Tufts Info Sec team)</h2>
<h2>Due: Thursday, April 19th</h2>

<h4 class="note">This assignment is worth 21 points.  You must work on this assignment individually!</h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Perform a technical risk analysis and static analysis of a vulnerable system used by Tufts. Then, work with Tufts to report on findings of the scan to the company that created it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>You will be assigned one of 5 recently deployed or in the works applications that Tufts is planning on using in some way.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: First things first, please manually review the source code!</p>

<p><strong>Part I, 10 points.</strong> While the goal of our CTF game was to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a system (i.e., flags), you also performed a number of activities, not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Penetration testing</li>
	<li>"Ethical hacking"</li>
	<li>Conducting research</li>
	<li>Gathering artifacts</li>
	<li>Interviewing people</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine that you are a managing consultant for a major security company or the Chief Security Officer (CSO) for Tufts, and assume that the business context of the system is critical, perform a technical risk analysis of the Tufts app you are assigned.  That is, you are to apply a general risk management framework (largely taken from Cigital's Risk Management Framework).  This framework can be used by managers and software engineers to identify, track, rank, monitor, and understand risks for a project or system.  The output of this activity shall be a table with eight columns:</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Column Name</th>
		<th>Information</th>
		<th>Example (an actual example you can use)</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Risk ID</td>
		<td>A sequential identifier for risk</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Technical Risk</td>
		<td>Brief description</td>
		<td>User authentication to the WordPress blog can be brute-forced.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Techical Risk Indicators</td>
		<td>Evidence of the risk occurring, including line number(s) in source code.</td>
		<td>Number of incorrect logins for accounts seen in logs; performance of login server has been degrading.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Related CWE or CVE IDs</td>
		<td>Use comma to separate multiple IDs</td>
		<td>CWE-521: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html" target="_blank">https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/521.html</a></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Impact Rating</td>
		<td>Use NIST standard and your judgement call: (H)igh, (M)edium, (L)ow
			<p>High - "The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals"</p>
<p>Medium - "The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals."</p>
<p>Low - "The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals."</p>
		</td>
		<td>H</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Impact</td>
		<td>Possible results of the risk, impacting the goals of the product.</td>
		<td>Increased load on login server; slower performance; possible denial of service</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Mitigation</td>
		<td>Action taken to reduce the probability of the risk actually occurring or how to actually fix the bug.  There may be more than one way to mitigate a risk.</td>
		<td>Lock out user account on 5 incorrect password tries by setting account lockout flag to true.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="stress">Validation Steps</td>
		<td>How do you ensure that risk was mitigated?</td>
		<td>Account lockout flag set for user account on 5 incorrect password tries.</td>
	</tr>

<p>In practice and in industry, the technical risk analysis table is used to correlate with <span class="stress">business risks</span>.   Your job is to produce a technical risk table for the entire CTF game.  Each of the vulnerabilities that you found in the CTF game should be a technical risk.  If you perform a Tenable Nessus static analysis scan on the app's system, it is wise to use the results from the report on your technical risk table.  However, do not rely solely on the static analysis report.  There are numerous additional critical vulnerabilities in the system that were not part of the game directly.</p>

<p><strong>Part II, 3 points.</strong> You should have received an email to use Tenable Nessus and IBM AppScan Dynamic scanner to create static and dynamic scans of application(s), and to review scan reports.  Create and run a static scan of the app provided to you.

<p><strong>Part III, 2 points.</strong> Compare your technical risks table with the results of the static analysis scan of your app.  In a <code>README.md</code>, note the similarities and differences between your findings and the static analysis scan.  What did you miss?  What do you wish the scanner report provided?</p>

<p><strong>Part IV, 6 points. </strong> Answer these 3 questions with regards to this app at Tufts in your README.md</p>
<p> 1. What vulnerabilites that you found do you think are the most likely to be exploited at Tufts? </p>
<p> 2. Pick 3 vulnerabilities and go into more detail about the steps you would take to fix them.</p>
<p> 3. Should Tufts continue using this app while reporting on the fixes made? Why or why not?</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>For your static scan, I will be able to view your application and scan results on my Veracode Analysis Center dashboard. Submit <code>README.txt</code> or <code>README.md</code> and your technical risk table in PDF format to Trunk. The top performer on each of the 5 apps will have their work given to the InfoSec team at Tufts and will be able to work with them on contacting the developers to fix the vulnerabilities. Then, they will report back on how that process went at a later class.</p>
